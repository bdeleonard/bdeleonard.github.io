### What will be display on the title page?
------------------
The title page will keep track of the latest (open source) project I am working on, most of which will be offline projects for Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path courses and lessons for the current time being while I progress through the career path to further educate myself with Web Development.

### Main Objective
------------------
- Objective of documentation is to maintain an environment suitable for displaying projects and to keep track of progress made within Codecademy's Full Stack Career Path.
> Finding errors within the code and/or making regular changes will be documented to keep track and order of progress.
- Project will maintain a open source aspect and strive to remain open to the community at large.
> Entirety of code and resources are displayed here on Github on a public repository, to be viewed, cloned, etc.
- Easy to follow coding progression and ability to easily maintain current or past code
> Ability to branch off of current work and continue or change the course of the project completely.
