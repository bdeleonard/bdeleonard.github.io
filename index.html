          This page is dedicated to making a basic portfolio page for the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path" target="_blank">Full Stack Engineer Career Path</a> project, but also a functioning page that we will keep updated upon further projects being added and possible upgrade/updates to current and/or past projects.
          
          This page features a simple design to keep ease of use high but to also display relavant projects and/or information pertaining to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/BradleyDeleonard" target="_blank">My Codecademy Journey!</a>

          ### What will be display here on the title page?
          ------------------
          This page will keep track of the latest (open source) project I am working on, most of which will be offline projects for Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path courses and lessons for the current time being while I progress through the career path to further educate myself with Web Development.

          - Objective of documentation is to maintain an environment suitable for displaying projects and to keep track of progress made within Codecademy's Full Stack Career Path.
          > Finding errors within the code and/or making regular changes will be documented to keep track and order of progress.
          - Project will maintain a open source aspect and strive to remain open to the community at large.
          > Entirety of code and resources are displayed here on Github on a public repository, to be viewed, cloned, etc.
          - Easy to follow coding progression and ability to easily maintain current or past code
          > Ability to branch off of current work and continue or change the course of the project completely.
